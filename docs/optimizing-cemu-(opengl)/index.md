In this section, we make sure that Cemu is running as fast as it can. This involves changing some options in Cemu and your GPU settings to make sure we're getting the best performance.

To continue, we need to know what GPU your system is using. If you don't know what type of graphics processor you have, open the Settings app on Windows 10. Then navigate to `System` -> `Display` -> `Advanced display settings`.

Under your display name, it should say `Display #: Connected to [GPU]`. This should start with Intel, AMD or NVIDIA. That will tell you what brand of GPU you have.
