In this section we'll be configuring controller inputs for Cemu, and setting up motion controls.

This can vary between controllers. Nintendo Switch, Dualshock 4 and DualSense controllers all have support for motion controls.

Other controllers, such as Xbox controllers, don't support motion controls and will need to use an alternate method.

Please select your controller type below:
