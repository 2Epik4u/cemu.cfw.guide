title: Dumping Games (FTP and disc2app)
---

In this section, we look at how to "dump" (copy) your games from your Wii U system over to your PC.

To do this, we're going to need to use a custom homebrew application to dump your games. This is done using an exploit in the Wii U browser.

This process is different for physical and digital games, so select the method that applies to you.
