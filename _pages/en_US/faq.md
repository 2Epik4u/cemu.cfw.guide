## Does Cemu support 32-bit systems?

No, Cemu will never support 32-bit systems. 32-bit applications can only use up to 4GB of RAM, which Cemu frequently exceeds.

## Does Cemu support MacOS or Linux?

While Cemu have stated in the past that a Linux build is planned in the distant future, currently no builds are available for MacOS or Linux.

Many users have managed to get Cemu working in [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/), however for best performance, we recommend running the emulator on Windows only.

## How do I play games if I don't have a Wii U?

You don't. We do not support piracy here and obtaining games without dumping from your own content is illegal.

## Can I play online without dumping files from my Wii U?

No, you must dump files from your Wii U to play online.

Think of them as a "username and password" to Nintendo servers. Nintendo gives each Wii U an authentication to access their servers, and without it, Nintendo won't allow you to connect to them.
